      "Summary: We present StyleMotif, a novel Stylized Motion Latent Diffusion model, generating motion conditioned on both content and style from multiple modalities. Unlike existing approaches that either focus on generating diverse motion content or transferring style from sequences, StyleMotif seamlessly synthesizes motion across a wide range of content while incorporating stylistic cues from multi-modal inputs, including motion, text, image, video, and audio. To achieve this, we introduce a style-content cross fusion mechanism and align a style encoder with a pre-trained multi-modal model, ensuring that the generated motion accurately captures the reference style while preserving realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework surpasses existing methods in stylized motion generation and exhibits emergent capabilities for multi-modal motion stylization, enabling more nuanced motion synthesis. Source code and pre-trained models will be released upon acceptance. Project Page: https://stylemotif.github.io\n",

      "Summary: Establishing character shape correspondence is a critical and fundamental task in computer vision and graphics, with diverse applications including re-topology, attribute transfer, and shape interpolation. Current dominant functional map methods, while effective in controlled scenarios, struggle in real situations with more complex challenges such as non-isometric shape discrepancies. In response, we revisit registration-for-correspondence methods and tap their potential for more stable shape correspondence estimation. To overcome their common issues including unstable deformations and the necessity for careful pre-alignment or high-quality initial 3D correspondences, we introduce Stable-SCore: A Stable Registration-based Framework for 3D Shape Correspondence. We first re-purpose a foundation model for 2D character correspondence that ensures reliable and stable 2D mappings. Crucially, we propose a novel Semantic Flow Guided Registration approach that leverages 2D correspondence to guide mesh deformations. Our framework significantly surpasses existing methods in challenging scenarios, and brings possibilities for a wide array of real applications, as demonstrated in our results.\n",

      "Summary: This paper presents a unified approach to understanding dynamic scenes from casual videos. Large pretrained vision foundation models, such as vision-language, video depth prediction, motion tracking, and segmentation models, offer promising capabilities. However, training a single model for comprehensive 4D understanding remains challenging. We introduce Uni4D, a multi-stage optimization framework that harnesses multiple pretrained models to advance dynamic 3D modeling, including static/dynamic reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and dense 3D motion tracking. Our results show state-of-the-art performance in dynamic 4D modeling with superior visual quality. Notably, Uni4D requires no retraining or fine-tuning, highlighting the effectiveness of repurposing visual foundation models for 4D understanding.\n",

      "Summary: Large language model (LLM) agents have evolved to intelligently process information, make decisions, and interact with users or tools. A key capability is the integration of long-term memory capabilities, enabling these agents to draw upon historical interactions and knowledge. However, the growing memory size and need for semantic structuring pose significant challenges. In this work, we propose an autonomous memory augmentation approach, MemInsight, to enhance semantic data representation and retrieval mechanisms. By leveraging autonomous augmentation to historical interactions, LLM agents are shown to deliver more accurate and contextualized responses. We empirically validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in three task scenarios; conversational recommendation, question answering and event summarization. On the LLM-REDIAL dataset, MemInsight boosts persuasiveness of recommendations by up to 14%. Moreover, it outperforms a RAG baseline by 34% in recall for LoCoMo retrieval. Our empirical results show the potential of MemInsight to enhance the contextual performance of LLM agents across multiple tasks.\n",

      "Summary: In this work, we aim to compress the vision tokens of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) into a representation that is simultaneously suitable for (a) generative and (b) discriminative tasks, (c) is nearly lossless, and (d) is storage-efficient. We propose a novel compression approach, called Fwd2Bot, that uses the LVLM itself to compress the visual information in a task-agnostic manner. At the core of Fwd2bot there exists a \"double-forward pass\" training strategy, whereby, during the first forward pass, the LLM (of the LVLM) creates a bottleneck by condensing the visual information into a small number of summary tokens. Then, using the same LLM, the second forward pass processes the language instruction(s) alongside the summary tokens, used as a direct replacement for the image ones. The training signal is provided by two losses: an autoregressive one applied after the second pass that provides a direct optimization objective for compression, and a contrastive loss, applied after the first pass, that further boosts the representation strength, especially for discriminative tasks. The training is further enhanced by stage-specific adapters. We accompany the proposed method by an in-depth ablation study. Overall, Fwd2Bot results in highly-informative compressed representations suitable for both generative and discriminative tasks. For generative tasks, we offer a 2x higher compression rate without compromising the generative capabilities, setting a new state-of-the-art result. For discriminative tasks, we set a new state-of-the-art on image retrieval and compositionality.\n",

      "Summary: It is one of the most fundamental objectives in quantum information science to understand the boundary between the computational power of classical and quantum computers. One possible avenue to explore this boundary is to identify classes of quantum circuits that can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. Instead of simulating a general quantum circuit with a classical device, new schemes have recently emerged to simulate them on a quantum device that is restricted in some manner. As such, these techniques allow us to study how the restrictions impact the computational power of the device. One such technique is called quasiprobability simulation (QPS) and it estimates the result of a quantum circuit with a Monte Carlo procedure that randomly replaces circuit elements with ones that can be executed on the restricted quantum device.   The main focus of this thesis is dedicated to the QPS-based simulation of nonlocal quantum computation using local quantum operations. On the practical side, this enables the simulation of large quantum circuits using multiple smaller quantum devices - a procedure that is sometimes called circuit knitting. We uncover a rich mathematical formalism with many connections to the resource theory of entanglement. We characterize the optimal simulation overhead for a broad range of practically relevant nonlocal states and channels and we explicitly provide achieving protocols. Moreover, we also investigate the utility of classical communication between the local parties. Our results address both the single-shot and asymptotic regime.   We frame QPS in a quantum resource theoretic framework, which highlights similarities that arise in the different instantiations of the technique. Furthermore, we study the importance of classical side information in the QPS procedure and how it impacts the overhead and expressibility of QPS.\n",

      "Summary: The topological string/spectral theory correspondence establishes a precise, non-perturbative duality between topological strings on local Calabi-Yau threefolds and the spectral theory of quantized mirror curves. While this duality has been rigorously formulated for the closed topological string sector, the open string sector remains less understood. Building on the results of [1-3], we make further progress in this direction by constructing entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the quantized mirror curve from open topological string partition functions. We focus on local $\\mathbb{F}_0$, whose mirror curve corresponds to the Baxter equation of the two-particle, relativistic Toda lattice. We then study the standard and dual four-dimensional limits, where the quantum mirror curve for local $\\mathbb{F}_0$ degenerates into the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, respectively. In these limits, our framework provides a way to construct entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the difference equations associated with these operators. Furthermore, we find a simple relation between the on-shell eigenfunctions of the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, leading to a functional relation between the operators themselves.\n",

Although the method is empirically well-motivated and appealing from a practical point of view, it lacks a theoretical foundation. In this work, we derive DyT mathematically and show that a well-defined approximation is needed to do so. By dropping said approximation, an alternative element-wise transformation is obtained, which we call Elementwise Layer Normalization (ELN). We demonstrate that ELN resembles Layer Normalization more accurately than DyT does.\n",

      "Summary: A formal series in noncommuting variables $\\Sigma$ over the rationals is a mapping $\\Sigma^* \\to \\mathbb Q$. We say that a series is commutative if the value in the output does not depend on the order of the symbols in the input. The commutativity problem for a class of series takes as input a (finite presentation of) a series from the class and amounts to establishing whether it is commutative. This is a very natural, albeit nontrivial problem, which has not been considered before from an algorithmic perspective.   We show that commutativity is decidable for all classes of series that constitute a so-called effective prevariety, a notion generalising Reutenauer's varieties of formal series. For example, the class of rational series, introduced by Sch\\\"utzenberger in the 1960's, is well-known to be an effective (pre)variety, and thus commutativity is decidable for it.   In order to showcase the applicability of our result, we consider classes of formal series generalising the rational ones. We consider polynomial automata, shuffle automata, and infiltration automata, and we show that each of these models recognises an effective prevariety of formal series. Consequently, their commutativity problem is decidable, which is a novel result. We find it remarkable that commutativity can be decided in a uniform way for such disparate computation models.   Finally, we present applications of commutativity outside the theory of formal series. We show that we can decide solvability in sequences and in power series for restricted classes of algebraic difference and differential equations, for which such problems are undecidable in full generality. Thanks to this, we can prove that the syntaxes of multivariate polynomial recursive sequences and of constructible differentially algebraic power series are effective, which are new results which were left open in previous work.\n",

      "Summary: This paper proposes a novel scene understanding task called Visual Jenga. Drawing inspiration from the game Jenga, the proposed task involves progressively removing objects from a single image until only the background remains. Just as Jenga players must understand structural dependencies to maintain tower stability, our task reveals the intrinsic relationships between scene elements by systematically exploring which objects can be removed while preserving scene coherence in both physical and geometric sense. As a starting point for tackling the Visual Jenga task, we propose a simple, data-driven, training-free approach that is surprisingly effective on a range of real-world images. The principle behind our approach is to utilize the asymmetry in the pairwise relationships between objects within a scene and employ a large inpainting model to generate a set of counterfactuals to quantify the asymmetry.\n",

      "Summary: Recent advancements in video generation have witnessed significant progress, especially with the rapid advancement of diffusion models. Despite this, their deficiencies in physical cognition have gradually received widespread attention - generated content often violates the fundamental laws of physics, falling into the dilemma of ''visual realism but physical absurdity\". Researchers began to increasingly recognize the importance of physical fidelity in video generation and attempted to integrate heuristic physical cognition such as motion representations and physical knowledge into generative systems to simulate real-world dynamic scenarios. Considering the lack of a systematic overview in this field, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive summary of architecture designs and their applications to fill this gap. Specifically, we discuss and organize the evolutionary process of physical cognition in video generation from a cognitive science perspective, while proposing a three-tier taxonomy: 1) basic schema perception for generation, 2) passive cognition of physical knowledge for generation, and 3) active cognition for world simulation, encompassing state-of-the-art methods, classical paradigms, and benchmarks. Subsequently, we emphasize the inherent key challenges in this domain and delineate potential pathways for future research, contributing to advancing the frontiers of discussion in both academia and industry. Through structured review and interdisciplinary analysis, this survey aims to provide directional guidance for developing interpretable, controllable, and physically consistent video generation paradigms, thereby propelling generative models from the stage of ''visual mimicry'' towards a new phase of ''human-like physical comprehension''.\n",

      "Summary: Video generation has advanced significantly, evolving from producing unrealistic outputs to generating videos that appear visually convincing and temporally coherent. To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence. However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres to real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just visually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real \"world models\" through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning, anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and simulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative models for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored for individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such as state-of-the-art VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection methods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive annotations to ensure alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of intrinsic faithfulness.\n",

The better weather may improve the quality of fruit that is still on the trees. But even with the return of rainfall, the 2024-25 orange crop has presented low quality, the Center for Advanced Studies on Applied Economics (CEPEA) in the Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture at the University of São Paulo reported. Fundecitrus and its cooperators issued the first update to Brazil's 2024-25 orange crop forecast on Sept. 10. The forecast of 215.78 million boxes for the São Paulo and West-Southwest Minas Gerais Citrus Belt is down 7.1% from the initial May forecast of 232.38 million boxes. With a total reduction of 16.6 million boxes, all varieties are expected to have lower production. The numbers by ... The updated orange production forecast for the 2024/25 season in Brazil reflects a positive trend, driven by favorable weather and improved pest control efforts. Despite this decrease, Brazil's production is anticipated to recover slightly from the current season, which was the lowest since 1988. Post forecasts orange weight at 160 grams/5.64 ounces in MY 2024/25, three percent lighter than Post's previous estimate of 165 grams for MY 2023/24 due to adverse weather conditions.\u001B[0m\u001B[32;1m\u001B[1;3mThe current weather conditions in Brazil have negatively impacted orange production, with forecasts indicating a significant decrease in the 2024/25 season. Despite some improvements in weather and pest control efforts, production is still expected to be lower than previous estimates.\n",

Orange prices experienced significant fluctuations in 2024, and several factors are influencing predictions for 2025. Factors like weather conditions, diseases (such as citrus greening), and harvest yields play crucial roles in determining supply.
